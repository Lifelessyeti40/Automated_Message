# Automated_Message

This was made in a small amount of fun, if you have someone messaging you and they just will not stop then you can now send them the entire script of "Shrek". 

You can of course send any script or junk message to someone, all you will need to do is amend the "message.txt" file with in the text editor and save it

*Educational Purpose of course!*

*How Do I Run This Script?*
-------------------------------------------------

To run this script you will need to take the code and paste it into your prefered text editor, once you have the code file and your ```message.txt``` file created, within the code, line 8 - ```time.sleep(10)```<-- this figure can be changed to any figure you like. It was added in order to give the user some time to run the script and go choose the website or chat they would like to click into. Once the sleep timer has hit 0 then the text from the message.txt file will start to be pasted.

*What if I have an issue?*
-------------------------------------------------
You can reach me on Discord (LifelessYeti#5586) - I will be happy to discuss and help with any concerns or issues

Happy Sending :)
